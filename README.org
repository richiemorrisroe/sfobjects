* Stockfigter Spoilers!!!

This repository is full of them. 

If you are looking for an R client, look [[https://github.com/richiemorrisroe/stockfighterr][here]]. 

Otherwise, you will be spoiled. 


More seriously, this package represents some code that I built on top of the client for Stockfighter referenced above. It's probably only useful in that context.
